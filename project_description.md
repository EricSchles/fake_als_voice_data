# Generating Fake ALS data

Inspiration: https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-18-youtube-age-of-ai-now-available.html

The basic idea behind this project is simple.  Take a normal voice record, translate it to a waveform, then "blur" it to sound like a person with ALS.  Then fine tune on the individual in question.  My guess is they should only need to record like 50 or 100 sentences.  

Use a wavelet model for this.
